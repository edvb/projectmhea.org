Making up one-fifth of the population, 15-24 year-olds carry with them India's
legacy as they drive the fruit of its political, economic, social and business
decisions sanctioned by the authoritative heads at the centre. Bearing the
burden of a densely populated country like India is no small task, and drug
abuse does nothing to lighten the load for India's youth.

## Why is the youth more susceptible to drug addiction?

The brain is intricately involved in any addiction, and for many teenagers, the
addiction susceptibility disorder is present before they ever begin using
substances. For others, repeated drug abuse creates significant changes in the
brain, making them dependent on a rigid reinforcement system of abusing drugs
every time that they have the crave to feel better. For most, it is the complex
interaction between genetic and environmental factors with the abuse of
addictive substances that paves the downward spiral of physical and emotional
dependency.

The susceptibility of young people to developing addictions more rapidly has to
do with the fact that the brain is immature and not fully developed until
around age 25. Just recently, researchers have been able to determine which
specific areas of an adolescent's underdeveloped brain are implicated in their
vulnerability to addiction.

## What is the biology of drug addiction?

Scientists have recently pinpointed a specific protein in the brain called elF2
that accounts for adolescents' hypersensitivity to addictive drugs. Research
support involved two studies with mice, along with evidence of generalization
from brain imaging in human addicts.

## What is the social perspective of drug addiction?

As youngsters become more independent, parents' influence often diminishes, and
as part of life's natural progression, teenagers are influenced more and more
by their peers. As might be guessed, one of the most powerful tools used to
sway young people towards drug addiction is peer pressure, and peer influences
in the area of drug abuse can begin as early as middle school.

## What are the effects of substance dependency?

Teens who abuse drugs are more likely to struggle with addiction later in life
and have permanent and irreversible brain damage.

Some symptoms include a change in peer group, carelessness with grooming,
decline in academic performance, missing classes or skipping school, loss of
interest in favourite activities, trouble in school or with the law, changes in
eating or sleeping habits, and deteriorating relationships with family members
and friends.

## How can we prevent and protect the youth from future drug abuse?

Creating healthy and attractive alternatives to drug abuse can curb the number
of first-time users. The United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime
Prevention has come out with a handbook to help communities prevent drug abuse.
Some basic prevention ideas include:

* Promotion of positive mental health
* Focus on people and encouragement of social interaction
* Local involvement of young people and respect for cultural values
* Encouragement of positive alternatives
* Achieving a long-term perspective
* Community development.

With this knowledge in mind, we can lessen the dependency that our society has
on drugs and establish positive mental health environments in order to make
changes that will lead to healthier and safer lives for the youth of India.
