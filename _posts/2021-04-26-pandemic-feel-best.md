## Drink Your Nutrients

Even in quarantine, many of us are still on the go. The responsibilities of remote school and
social isolation make it easy to cut corners when it comes to nutrition. But remember, what you
eat impacts how you look and feel. If your energy is low, you aren’t sleeping well, or your skin
is starting to break out, consider different types of superfood to boost your [immune system][2],
reduce inflammation, and improve your overall health and well-being.

## Focus on Self-Care

Now is a great time to learn the true meaning of self-care and put it into practice. Contrary to
trendy websites and magazines, [caring for yourself][3] consists of more than bath bombs and facials.
It’s about detoxifying every area of your life and creating daily habits and routines that are
both healthy and joyful. For example, creating a space you love and keeping it clean can [help you
control][4] the amount of stress and anxiety you feel. By learning these important skills early on,
you are setting yourself up for success throughout your life.

## Cook More

While many restaurants continue to offer meals through delivery and curbside, nothing will protect
you from the pandemic and help you learn to care for yourself like learning to cook healthy,
delicious meals. If you are brand new to cooking, start with the basics. Once you’ve mastered
simple meals, you can try new ingredients and recipes based on the flavors and cooking techniques
you enjoy.

## Exercise Online

The pandemic has taken away many outlets for physical activities, like recreational team sports
and just playing in the yard with friends. Moreover, even though we know exercise is one of the
easiest and most effective ways to improve health and appearance, the pandemic depression can
exacerbate the struggle. Luckily there is the internet. You can workout to free, kid- and
adolescent-friendly [YouTube videos][5], subscribe to [online yoga classes][6] or even take [group fitness
classes][7] live online with Zoom and other live streaming platforms.

## Meditate to Reduce Stress

One of the most scientifically proven ways to glow inside and out is to take up a regular
[meditation][8] practice. The stress-reduction you feel will not only be immediate, but will also grow
and deepen over time. Meditation is another skill that, [learned early][9] and practiced often, can
improve grades, reduce altercations, and help young people better manage their emotions. You can
use guided meditation apps on your phone or simply spend 10-20 minutes sitting in silence.
