      quote: 'A few of my friends suffered from depression throughout high school and the lack of resources for them to turn to aggravated the issue. They didnâ€™t have anybody to talk to for fear of being labeled by people. I want to see that this is no longer an issue, and that people get the help they need. I hope we finally get to see the day when young students in high school can perform to their full potential and are not held back by mental health issues that they can get help with.'
