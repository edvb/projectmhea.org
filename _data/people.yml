    quote: "Ever since I have come across the organisation, MHEA, it has only helped and educated me. Considering how deep-rooted the issue of mental health is, in terms of the stigma attached to it, the reluctance to seek help, or people's perception towards those with mental illness, we still have a long way to go. With MHEA,  I continue to strive to make the community around me as educated about mental health as they can be."

    quote: "During my schooling in India, I've seen friends grappling with depression and anxiety unable to seek help because of the stigma associated with mental health issues. My time at UW helped me understand that the first step to providing effective mental healthcare was to create a conducive atmosphere that facilitates conversations about this very important issue. Through the MHEA workshops, I hope to help do away with misinformed perceptions regarding mental illnesses, and emphasize the need to seek treatment just as one would with physical illness."

    quote: "MHEA's unique idea of conducting workshops that specifically focused on mental health issues really piqued my interest. I had personally experienced depression in grade 11; I felt that MHEA is the right platform to not only salvage myself from my situation, but also educate others about mental health issues."
