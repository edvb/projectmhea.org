    quote: "Ever since I have come across the organisation, MHEA, it has only helped and educated me. Considering how deep-rooted the issue of mental health is, in terms of the stigma attached to it, the reluctance to seek help, or people's perception towards those with mental illness, we still have a long way to go. With MHEA,  I continue to strive to make the community around me as educated about mental health as they can be."

    quote: "During my schooling in India, I've seen friends grappling with depression and anxiety unable to seek help because of the stigma associated with mental health issues. My time at UW helped me understand that the first step to providing effective mental healthcare was to create a conducive atmosphere that facilitates conversations about this very important issue. Through the MHEA workshops, I hope to help do away with misinformed perceptions regarding mental illnesses, and emphasize the need to seek treatment just as one would with physical illness."

    quote: "MHEA's unique idea of conducting workshops that specifically focused on mental health issues really piqued my interest. I had personally experienced depression in grade 11; I felt that MHEA is the right platform to not only salvage myself from my situation, but also educate others about mental health issues."

    desc: 'Hi! I am a first year medical student at the UT Houston McGovern Medical School. In the three years since founding MHEA, I have better understood the problem of healthcare inequality. I believe that healthcare should be a fundamental right, and not a privilege. To this end, I am committed to educating myself and thinking of innovative ways to close gaps in access to healthcare in our society.'

    desc: 'Hi! My name is Aniruddh and I am currently a research associate at Sana Biotechnology. I am a recent UW Bioengineering grad and have been a part of MHEA since my freshman year of college. I became a part of MHEA because I felt that often students are not adequately equipped to help themselves or a friend when it comes to mental health issues and the stigma around mental health makes it worse. I want to do something about this and destigmatize mental health.'
