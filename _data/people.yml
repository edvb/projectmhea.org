    desc: 'Sairandri is a sophomore at the University of Washington, Seattle, planning to study neurobiology and psychology. She conducts research on the neural mechanisms behind memory and learning. Additionally, she is working towards creating biosensors that can detect contaminants in water through an undergraduate research group. She is also a Peer Health Educator and conducts workshops, panels, and other programs to promote mental health awareness, healthy sexuality, and wellness on campus.'
    quote: 'During my schooling in India, I’ve seen friends grappling with depression and anxiety unable to seek help because of the stigma associated with mental health issues. My time at UW helped me understand that the first step to providing effective mental healthcare was to create a conducive atmosphere that facilitates conversations about this very important issue. Through the MHEA workshops, I hope to help do away with misinformed perceptions regarding mental illnesses, and emphasize the need to seek treatment just as one would with physical illness.'
